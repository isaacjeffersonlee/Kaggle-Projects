## Titanic

## Introduction
Binary classification problem, predicting who would have survived the titanic.

## Results
I did some experimentation with neural nets and Tensorflow but ended up using
a soft voting classifier with KNN, SVN and XGboost.
I achieved a score of 0.78708, placing me 1654 / 50585, which means I placed
in the top 3.27%.
